# Fibonacci
Getting Fibonacci sequence
This is computing Fibonacci sequence algorithm.
The naive recursion algorithm has O(2^n) complexity.
However, the complexity is reduced considerably by a basic memoization vector.
The vector can be used for lookup reducing the computation time to O(n) at the cost of memory equal to the length of the vetor which is n
